for future iterations:
 - create unique names for images when moving them into the uploads folder
 - delete images in the upload folder when deleting destination document in the mongodb
 - when updating a destination from edit form/page: do not overwrite image name in db if new one was not sent in the FormData
 - add validation that end date cannot be earlier than the start date (with pre save hook)
